A mobile-first application designed to streamline the restocking process for small business and grocery store owners. This app transforms the traditional clipboard-based restocking workflow into an efficient, AI-powered system that reduces restock time from 3-4 hours to 15-25 minutes.

## The Problem

Small business and grocery store owners often manage 50-200 product restocks per location manually. The traditional process involves:
- Walking the store with a clipboard to jot down product names
- Manually looking up each supplier
- Formatting individual emails
- Double-checking quantities
- Repeating this process for every store they manage

This is a slow, error-prone, and mentally draining process done several times a week.

## Our Solution

Restock is a mobile-first app that replicates the clipboard experience but with AI-powered email generation and a smart product-supplier database. The app enables users to:

- Log products quickly while walking the store
- Auto-link products to suppliers
- Generate and send professional emails in minutes
- Track past orders and save time every week

## Progressive Learning & AI Enhancement

The app builds a database from the user's own data, learning and remembering product-to-supplier mappings over time:

- Initially, users input products manually as usual
- Over weeks, the system offers smarter autocomplete suggestions
- The AI uses this data to generate emails with minimal input from the user
- Eventually, the process shifts from manual entry toward smart, predictive restocking assistance

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Restock Sessions: Create and manage restocking sessions with real-time product tracking
