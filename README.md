## The Problem

Small business and grocery store owners often manage 50-200 product restocks per location manually. The traditional process involves:
- Walking the store with a clipboard to jot down product names
- Manually looking up each supplier
- Formatting individual emails
- Double-checking quantities
- Repeating this process for every store they manage

This is a slow, error-prone, and mentally draining process done several times a week.

## Our Solution

Restock is a mobile-first app that replicates the clipboard experience but with AI-powered email generation and a smart product-supplier database. The app enables users to:

- Log products quickly while walking the store
- Auto-link products to suppliers
- Generate and send professional emails in minutes
- Track past orders and save time every week

## 🏗️ Architectural Evolution: From Functional Services to Clean Hexagonal Architecture

### The Initial Approach: Functional Service Architecture
Our development journey began with what we initially called a "functional, domain-driven service architecture." This approach featured:

- **Direct service imports** in React hooks (e.g., `SessionService`, `EmailService`)
- **Mixed concerns** where business logic lived alongside UI state management
- **Tight coupling** between frontend components and backend services
- **Multiple auth systems** creating complexity (UnifiedAuthProvider, AuthContext, ClerkAuthContext)
- **Inconsistent data access** patterns mixing direct Supabase calls with edge functions

**Why it seemed to work initially:**
- Fast development velocity for MVP features
- Direct access to services made implementation straightforward
- Functional composition appeared clean at the component level

**Where it broke down:**
- **Testing complexity**: Business logic couldn't be tested without React/Supabase
- **Maintenance overhead**: Changes in one layer cascaded unpredictably
- **Scalability issues**: Adding new features required understanding multiple layers
- **Error handling**: Failures in one service could crash entire UI flows

### The Transition: Recognizing Architectural Debt
As the codebase grew to 10,000+ lines, we identified critical architectural flaws:

1. **Violation of Single Responsibility**: React contexts handling business logic
2. **Dependency Inversion Violations**: UI directly importing concrete service implementations
3. **Mixed Abstraction Levels**: Domain entities mixed with infrastructure concerns
4. **Context Pollution**: Business rules scattered across React state management

### The Solution: Clean Hexagonal Architecture
We refactored to a clean hexagonal architecture following dependency inversion principles:

### Key Benefits Achieved

**✅ Testability**
- Domain logic testable without React/Supabase (27/27 tests passing)
- Use cases testable in isolation
- Mock interfaces instead of concrete services

**✅ Flexibility**
- Swap Supabase for different database without changing domain/application
- Replace GROQ with OpenAI without affecting business logic
- Change from Clerk to different auth provider

**✅ Maintainability**
- Clear boundaries between layers
- Business logic separated from infrastructure
- Single responsibility per use case

**✅ Production Readiness**
- Error boundaries handling failures gracefully
- Service health monitoring
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

### What We Learned

1. **Architecture is a journey, not a destination**: What works for 1,000 lines may fail at 10,000
2. **Dependency inversion is crucial**: UI should depend on abstractions, not implementations
3. **Testing drives good architecture**: If you can't test it easily, the architecture is wrong
4. **Refactoring is cheaper than rewriting**: Incremental architectural improvements pay dividends

This architectural evolution represents a significant investment in code quality that positions the app for long-term maintainability and feature development.
