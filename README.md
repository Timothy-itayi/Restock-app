## The Problem

Small business and grocery store owners often manage 50-200 product restocks per location manually. The traditional process involves:
- Walking the store with a clipboard to jot down product names
- Manually looking up each supplier
- Formatting individual emails
- Double-checking quantities
- Repeating this process for every store they manage

This is a slow, error-prone, and mentally draining process done several times a week.

## Our Solution

Restock is a mobile-first app that replicates the clipboard experience but with AI-powered email generation and a smart product-supplier database. The app enables users to:

- Log products quickly while walking the store
- Auto-link products to suppliers
- Generate and send professional emails in minutes
- Track past orders and save time every week

## Progressive Learning & AI Enhancement

The app builds a database from the user's own data, learning and remembering product-to-supplier mappings over time:

- Initially, users input products manually as usual
- Over weeks, the system offers smarter autocomplete suggestions
- The AI uses this data to generate emails with minimal input from the user
- Eventually, the process shifts from manual entry toward smart, predictive restocking assistance

## Core Features

### Core Functionality
- Restock Sessions: Create and manage restocking sessions with real-time product tracking
- Smart Product Entry: Auto-complete suggestions based on previously used products
- Supplier Management: Automatic supplier linking and email generation
- Email Generation: AI-powered email creation grouped by supplier
- Session History: Track and review past restocking sessions

### User Experience
- Mobile-First Design: Optimized for on-the-go store walking
- Minimalistic UI: Clean, distraction-free interface following user preferences
- One-Task-Per-Screen: Mental simplicity with focused workflows
- Smart Suggestions: Progressive learning system for faster data entry

## Technical Architecture

### Clean Hexagonal Architecture Implementation

Our development journey began with a functional service architecture that worked for initial development but created significant technical debt as the codebase grew to 10,000+ lines. We identified critical architectural flaws:

1. **Violation of Single Responsibility**: React contexts handling business logic
2. **Dependency Inversion Violations**: UI directly importing concrete service implementations
3. **Mixed Abstraction Levels**: Domain entities mixed with infrastructure concerns
4. **Context Pollution**: Business rules scattered across React state management

### The Solution: Clean Hexagonal Architecture

We refactored to a clean hexagonal architecture following dependency inversion principles:

### Key Benefits Achieved

**Testability** (╯°□°）╯
- Domain logic testable without React/Supabase (27/27 tests passing)
- Use cases testable in isolation
- Mock interfaces instead of concrete services

**Flexibility** (╯°□°）╯
- Swap Supabase for different database without changing domain/application
- Replace GROQ with OpenAI without affecting business logic
- Change from Clerk to different auth provider

**Maintainability** (╯°□°）╯
- Clear boundaries between layers
- Business logic separated from infrastructure
- Single responsibility per use case

**Production Readiness** (╯°□°）╯
- Error boundaries handling failures gracefully
- Service health monitoring
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

### What We Learned

1. **Architecture is a journey, not a destination**: What works for 1,000 lines may fail at 10,000
2. **Dependency inversion is crucial**: UI should depend on abstractions, not implementations
3. **Testing drives good architecture**: If you can't test it easily, the architecture is wrong
4. **Refactoring is cheaper than rewriting**: Incremental architectural improvements pay dividends

This architectural evolution represents a significant investment in code quality that positions the app for long-term maintainability and feature development.
