A mobile-first application designed to streamline the restocking process for small business and grocery store owners. This app transforms the traditional clipboard-based restocking workflow into an efficient, AI-powered system that reduces restock time from 3-4 hours to 15-25 minutes.

## The Problem

Small business and grocery store owners often manage 50-200 product restocks per location manually. The traditional process involves:
- Walking the store with a clipboard to jot down product names
- Manually looking up each supplier
- Formatting individual emails
- Double-checking quantities
- Repeating this process for every store they manage

This is a slow, error-prone, and mentally draining process done several times a week.

## Our Solution

Restock is a mobile-first app that replicates the clipboard experience but with AI-powered email generation and a smart product-supplier database. The app enables users to:

- Log products quickly while walking the store
- Auto-link products to suppliers
- Generate and send professional emails in minutes
- Track past orders and save time every week

- React Native with Expo SDK 53
- Expo Router (file-based routing)
- Zustand for state management
- NativeWind (Tailwind CSS) styling
- TypeScript with strict mode

**Backend Stack**
- Supabase (PostgreSQL database, authentication, edge functions)
- Clerk for authentication provider
- GROQ API for AI email generation
- Structured logging and error handling

**Development Tools**
- Jest + React Native Testing Library
- ESLint for code quality
- Custom component styling system
- Path aliases for clean imports

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication and profile management
- **Products**: User's restock items with supplier defaults
- **Suppliers**: Contact information for ordering
- **Restock Sessions**: Session tracking with status management
- **Restock Items**: Products and quantities per session
- **Emails Sent**: Email tracking and delivery status

### Key Metrics
- **8,000+ lines of code** implemented
- **20+ reusable components** built
- **6 database tables** with full relationships
- **Complete authentication flows** with OAuth support
- **AI-powered email generation** with user personalization

## Progressive Learning & AI Enhancement

The app builds a database from the user's own data, learning and remembering product-to-supplier mappings over time:

- Initially, users input products manually as usual
- Over weeks, the system offers smarter autocomplete suggestions
- The AI uses this data to generate emails with minimal input from the user
- Eventually, the process shifts from manual entry toward smart, predictive restocking assistance

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Restock Sessions: Create and manage restocking sessions with real-time product tracking
- Smart Product Entry: Auto-complete suggestions based on previously used products
- Supplier Management: Automatic supplier linking and email generation
- Email Generation: AI-powered email creation grouped by supplier
- Session History: Track and review past restocking sessions

### User Experience
- Mobile-First Design: Optimized for on-the-go store walking
- Minimalistic UI: Clean, distraction-free interface following user preferences
- One-Task-Per-Screen: Mental simplicity with focused workflows
- Smart Suggestions: Progressive learning system for faster data entry
