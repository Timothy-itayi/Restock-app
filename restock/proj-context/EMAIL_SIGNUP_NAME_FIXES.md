# 📧 Email Signup Name Capture Fixes - Complete Solution

## 🚩 Original Problem

For email signup users, the name field was `null` because:
1. **Clerk user object has no name fields** for email signup (names come from SSO)
2. **Name input field not shown** for email signup users
3. **No validation** requiring name for email signup
4. **Wrong name source** - trying to extract from Clerk instead of user input

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Updated Name Input Field Logic**

**Before:**
```typescript
{(!isGoogleSSO || (isSignedIn && !name)) && (
  <TextInput placeholder="Enter your first name" />
)}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{(!isGoogleSSO || (isSignedIn && !name) || showEmailSignup) && (
  <TextInput placeholder="Enter your first name" />
)}
```

Now the name input field is **always shown** for email signup users.

### 2. **Added Name Validation for Email Signup**

```typescript
// For email signup users, require name
if (showEmailSignup && !name.trim()) {
  Alert.alert('Error', 'Please enter your first name');
  return;
}
```

Email signup users **must enter their name** before proceeding.

### 3. **Prioritized Manually Entered Name**

```typescript
// For email signup users, use the manually entered name
const finalName = showEmailSignup ? name : (name || '');
console.log('Final name to be saved:', finalName);

const result = await UserProfileService.ensureUserProfile(userId, email, storeName, finalName);
```

For email signup, we use the **manually entered name** instead of trying to extract from Clerk.

### 4. **Enhanced Logging for Debugging**

```typescript
console.log('Saving user profile with data:', {
  userId,
  email,
  storeName,
  name,
  nameLength: name?.length || 0,
  nameIsEmpty: !name || name.trim() === '',
  isEmailSignup: showEmailSignup
});
```

Added detailed logging to track name capture process.

## 📊 Expected Database Record

After email signup with name:

  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe", // ✅ Now populated from user input
  "store_name": "My Store",
  "created_at": "2025-07-28T..."
}
```

## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### Manual Testing
1. **Sign up with email**:
   - Enter email and password
   - Enter name (should be required)
   - Enter store name
   - Verify email
   - Check database for name field

2. **Verify validation**:
   - Try to proceed without name
   - Should see error message
   - Name field should be required

3. **Check database**:
   - Verify name field is populated
   - Should not be null
   - Should match user input

## 🔧 Key Changes

### Before
- Name input not shown for email signup
- No name validation
- Trying to extract name from Clerk (which has no name for email signup)
- Name field null in database

### After
- Name input always shown for email signup
- Name validation required
- Uses manually entered name
- Name field properly populated in database

## 📝 Debug Steps

### 1. **Check Console Logs**
Look for these logs when testing email signup:
```
LOG  User name for account: John Doe
LOG  Saving user profile with data: { name: "John Doe", isEmailSignup: true }
LOG  Final name to be saved: John Doe
LOG  Ensuring user profile with data: { name: "John Doe" }
```

### 2. **Verify Validation**
- Try to proceed without entering name
- Should see: "Please enter your first name"
- Should not allow proceeding

### 3. **Check Database**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
-- Should show name field populated
```

The email signup name capture fixes ensure that users who sign up with email have their names properly captured from user input and stored in the database!
